## Instructions

Your task is to create an extremely simple version of the Microsoft Paint application. The application has the following requirements:

- It must be built using React and run in the browser.
- The app should support two tools: **pencil**, and **flood fill**.
- Those tools will need to support some kind of color picker. We would suggest using an open source package for this.
- The **canvas should be made up of squares, and be of configurable size**. The user should be able to input their desired dimensions for the canvas. You arenâ€™t required to maintain the drawing state when the user changes the canvas size.
- The user should be able to use the **pencil tool to colour individual squares by clicking on them**. 
- You do not need to implement any kind of drag-to-colour feature like is supported by the real pencil tool. (The user will have to click on each square to colour it.)
- The flood fill tool, should allow the user to fill in all connected squares of the same colour with another colour.
